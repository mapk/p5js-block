Run p5.js in your WordPress site with this Gutenberg block.


== Description ==

p5.js + WordPress. Want to share some generative art on your own WordPress site? This is the plugin to make it happen. Add your custom p5.js code, and preview it in the Gutenberg editor before publishing it on your page or post.

* Currently, this plugin does not work with `createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)`. You'll need to use actual integer values like, `createCanvas(700, 400)`.
* Currently, this plugin does not include the `p5.dom.js` or the `p5.sound.js` libraries.
